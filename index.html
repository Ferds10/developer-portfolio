            <h3>JavaScript & PHP developer</h3>
            <p>A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of
                World
                Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript
                in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications
                between client and server. A web developer may specialize in client-side applications (front-end
                developer),
                server-side applications (back-end developer), or both (full-stack developer). A web content management
                system may be used to develop and maintain web applications.</p>

                There are some qualities of web development careers, such as job availability and base salary, that make
                this option a great fit for anyone who wants a secure and high paying job. While good pay and

                itself are also high-ranking aspects of job satisfaction. Luckily, those also happen to be some of the
                primary benefits of web development as a career. Here are five reasons to go into web development that
                might convince you to get started today.</p>
